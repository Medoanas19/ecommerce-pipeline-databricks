### ðŸ“Š Dataset Source and Sampling

The original dataset is a large e-commerce clickstream dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mkechinov/ecommerce-behavior-data-from-multi-category-store) (~5.5 GB total across multiple months). Due to Databricks Community Edition limitations, I only used a smaller chunk for this project.

**Sample Used:** `2019-Nov.csv`

**File Location in Unity Catalog Volume:**

To reduce the size for initial testing and development, I extracted a smaller sample using the following code:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the full CSV (locally before uploading to Databricks)
df = pd.read_csv("2019-Nov.csv", nrows=10_000)  # First 10k rows

# Save to a new sample file
df.to_csv("2019-Nov-sample.csv", index=False)
